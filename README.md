# WLED Designer

Tool to help make designs for your WLED light strips and matrices.  After creating a design it will output the commands/payloads needed to push to the WLED REST apis.

## Example

[BTF-Lighting WS2812B 16x16 Light Matrix](https://a.co/6TSVFDc)

## Notes

After watching this [Creating PIXEL ART with WLED!! by Make It Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSex5f1qzH8), decided I needed a tool to help make designs and generate the commands needed to make the calls via curl and learn React at the same time.
